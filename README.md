Collection of n8n workflows to automate your e-commerce store.

# 🤖 The Auto-Commerce: AI-Powered E-commerce

Welcome! This repository is a collection of **n8n workflows** designed to shift e-commerce from manual labor to AI-driven automation. 

My goal is to share the blueprints for a truly "hands-off" e-commerce operation. Whether you are a solo-founder or a growing brand, these tools are built to help you scale without increasing your workload.

Wouldn't it be great if all of the e-commerce would be managed by AI?

## 🌟 The Vision
I believe that the future of commerce is **autonomous**. From customer support to inventory management and marketing, AI can handle the "busy work," allowing humans to focus on strategy and creativity.

## 🚀 How to Use These Workflows
1. **Download:** Grab the `.json` file from the workflow folder you are interested in.
2. **Import:** Open your n8n instance and drag the file onto the canvas.
3. **Configure:** Look for the **Orange Sticky Notes** inside the workflow. They will guide you on which API keys and credentials you need to plug in.
